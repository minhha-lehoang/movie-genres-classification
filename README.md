## Project description
**Movie genre classification** is a crucial task that has found applications in various fields. Can be treated as an _Extreme Multi-label Classification_ (XMC) task with long-tailed data, this problem is not only valuable in real-world domains, such as for recommendation systems, but also leave space for researches on XMC. In this experiment, we implement two different approach for this problem: Rating-based Collaborative Filtering and Label Correlation-based Multi-modal Network. We conduct our methods on the given MovieLens dataset, achieving the best macro F1-score of 0.56.
